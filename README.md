Philosophers is a 1337 School project that explores the dining philosophers problem, a classic synchronization problem in concurrent programming. The goal is to simulate a group of philosophers sitting at a table, eating, thinking, and trying to avoid deadlocks while sharing a limited number of forks. The project requires efficient multithreading and synchronization using mutexes in C.
